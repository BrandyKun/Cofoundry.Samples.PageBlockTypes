@inherits CofoundryPageModule<PageSnippetDisplayModel>

@*
    Here we can use the Cofoundry helper to set the description that
    gets displayed against the module in the administration interface.

    This is optional and doesn't render anything into the template itself.
*@
@Cofoundry.Module.UseDescription("Displays summary information about a page.")

@* 
    We have to code defensively here and bear in mind that the related
    entities may be in draft status and may not be available when viewing
    the live site.
